Environment:
1. Host PC Ubuntu 14.0.4
2. Device Yocto Poky 1.6.2
3. Qt 5.2
4. GCC /work/fsl-release-bsp/build-x11/tmp/sysroots/x86_64-linux/usr/bin/cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-g++

Problems 1. 
 I am trying to put OpenCV into a project. Because of the OpenCV already exist in Yocto environment.
 So I add these lines into .pro file to importing the libs and header files.
 
 >LIBS += -L/work/fsl-release-bsp/build-x11/tmp/sysroots/imx6qsabresd/usr/lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_ml
 >INCLUDEPATH += /work/fsl-release-bsp/build-x11/tmp/sysroots/imx6qsabresd/usr/include
 
 Then I got these errors after building.
 
 > cannot find /lib/libpthread.so.0
 > cannot find /usr/lib/libpthread_nonshared.a

Solution:
 Base on this: https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/2015-January/023356.html
 The problem was due to Qt could not find the 'sysroot', so needs add this line to indicate the 'sysroot' path for GCC.
